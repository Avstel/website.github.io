		Does it matter to use relative size when styling so as to be responsive?
	Yes. The use of Relative units specify a size relative to other length properties. 
Therefore when we use the relative size of the height for example, the width as well is
rendered down along with it. Therfore Relative size units are excellent at scaling to fit 
between different rendering mediums.
